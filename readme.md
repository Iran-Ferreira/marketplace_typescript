# Marketplace

A Marketplace with TypeScript, PostgresQL with ORM Prisma and Clean Architecture. I was inspired by a YouTube playlist.

## Learnings

I learned better how to use Prisma with PostgresQL.
My notebook is weak so I decided to stop using pgAdmin4 and started using PSQL. I learned better how to use the terminal with PSQL, so I used PSQL to use postgresQL more easily.

# Documentação

### - [Documentação Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started)

I don't think I need to do documentation about Prisma since there is a whole website for it.
In the .gitignore file you will see that I added a .env file, I used it to add my database settings.
Later I will do the API documentation
